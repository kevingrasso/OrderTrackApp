# Expected Outcomes

I expect the following outcomes from this project:
- Needfinding to define the requirements of the app, define personas and scenarios

- The interface intuitive and easy to use, where all information related to shipments will be displayed.
- A database were i can save all data.
- A server from which can retrieve all information regarding shipments.
